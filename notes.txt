2 May 2019 (SJS):
---------------------------
fixed:
	attenuation
	wav onset fixed in files to 50ms from beginning of file
	randomization fixed
Work to do:
	- need to add gain/filtering information to Dinf (written to header of datafile)?
   - noise stim needs 50 ms additional delay in order to match onset of wav file?
   - derandomize still needs attention
	- currently working on analysis of MTwav data script

---------------------------
working on wav stimulation. 
still need to do:
work out attenuation
figure out wav files - onset/offset
	set to 50 ms uniformly?
randomization,
	how to handle multiple levels?
	derandomize for analysis
test!

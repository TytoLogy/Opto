Updating Wav stimuli in opto program:

Revisions:
	1 Oct 2019 (SJS)

Assumptions:
	- peak dB SPL levels of the WAV stimuli are known
	- MTwav and associated scripts are used
			MTwav_settings.m, MTwav_standalone.m, others...?
	- all wav stimuli are in a single directory on experimental machine

Steps:

A. Use NICal to measure audio system frequency response, then use
	FlatWav to compensate and/or measure the peak amplitude (in dB SPL) of each
	stimulus.

B. Run buildWavInfo function to determine onset and offset of each stimulus
		buildWavInfo will create a mat file, wavinfo.mat, that holds a struct with
		information about each wav file

C. edit Scripts\MTwav_settings.m:
	1. update audio.signal.WavPath with proper directory with wav files 
	2. update cell WavesToPlay with list of wav file names
	3. update vector WavLevelAtScale with peak dB SPL values for each wav stimulus
	   this is usually measured with FlatWav during signal compensation for 
		speaker frequency response
	4. update WavRamp value with desired onset/offset ramp or taper duration
			this is in milliseconds, and will be applied to the first and last 
			portions of the wav file
	5. If # of wav stimuli has changed, modify PLOT_ROWS and PLOT_COLS to 
		standalone_wav_setupplots.m
		* depending on # of plots, more drastic changes may be needed....
		* be sure to factor in 2 more stimuli - null and BBN

D. edit opto_InitH.m:
	1. if needed:
			- change path to wave files in the wav = struct(....) statement
			- change default wav file

E. edit opto_InitializeGui.m:
	1. update calpath with path to calibration data file
	2. update calfile with name of calibration data file
